# CUCM-Configs
This is some configs for CUCM after initial install. When i first set up CUCM, i had no idea it was such a beast. I thought it was just: BOOM! install, plug in the phones, slap a config for _just_ the phone, and good to go... But i was wrong. There are actually a lot of settings and configurations that need to go on before you actually configure a phone. 

A little preface: I originally started this lab and my [CUCM Install Lab](https://github.com/Matthew-Requejo559/CUCM-install/blob/main/README.md) because at my job, there is 1 guy who is the Phone Commander, and they don't let other people touch the phone system. Everybody says, "Oh, it can't even be that compicated, i don't know why they don't let other people do it!" OR "Why do we gotta wait for that guy to do the phones! They should let anyone do it." I knew there had to be a valid reason, and i wanted to know for myself. And since i did not have access to CUCM at my work, i decided to build my own.

If only they knew how complicated and structured  it was...
